            <h1>International Space Settlement Design Competition</h1>
            <p>
                In 2017 I joined a space settlement design competition from my school. There were 12 of us, 
                divided in groups of 3, each assigned a specific aspect of the spaceship. I was opted to go into 
                structural design. There were many hurdles in the way, from coming up with the design to figuring 
                out the specifics. What I learned from the quarter final round apart from the various materials
                that can be used for various applications in a space settlement and the specific of G forces was 
                communication and teamwork. At one point I was down with a fever but conveying the values was more
                impportant to me as time was less, my teammates, being the understanding people they were, handled 
                the situation that day without me being present there, and I did what I could lying in bed, doing 
                calculations and conveying the same to my team

            <h1>The Semi-Final</h1>
            <p>
                We cleared the inter-school level of the competition and were selected for the National level.
                We had to go to Delhi for this leg of the competition and everyone was really excited cause apart
                from competing on the National level, there was one other thing all of us knew. We were gonna have
                fun. The competion itself was gonna last 3 days. the 1st day was to get aquainted with the place -
                Om Shanti Retreat Centre. It was amazingly calm and peaceful at all times. I even saw a peacock,
                wandering about freely.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second day and night were all about the competition. A team consisted of four different schools
                grouped together, and there were four such teams. We had 24 hours to design a space settlement according 
                to the Statement
